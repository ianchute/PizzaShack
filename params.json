NodeJS (version 0.10.36)\r\n 5. yo, bower, grunt\r\n\r\nI made this for my own continuous self-improvement.\r\nI am trying to apply best practices w.r.t. architecture, test-driven development and UX design.\r\nFor others who wish to use it, you may do so freely (that would make me very happy).\r\nCurrently, it is still at its infant stage and it doesn't do much.\r\n\r\nTo get your copy: <b>git clone https://github.com/ianchute/PizzaShack</b>\r\n\r\nNOTE: This app is unwatered.\r\n\r\nHow to water:\r\n 1. Open the solution.\r\n 2. Build the solution.\r\n 3. Install http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.0/x64/node-v0.10.36-x64.msi (or, the 32-bit one)<br>\r\n    -- if you have another version, you will need to uninstall it so that the yeoman scaffolder will work properly.<br>\r\n    (If you had NodeJS before, ensure that %appdata%/npm and %appdata%/npm-cache are both empty)\r\n 4. Install msysgit \r\n 5. Add mysysgit's bin and cmd folders to the PATH environmental variable\r\n 6. In the Frontend Folder, execute <b>npm install</b>\r\n 7. Install bower by executing <b>npm install bower</b>\r\n 8. <b>bower install</b>\r\n 9. <b>npm install grunt</b>\r\n 10. To run the website:<br>\r\n     First, run the backend (F5/F11 in Visual Studio).<br>\r\n     Then execute <b>grunt serve</b> within the Frontend folder.\r\n\r\nFor any problems encountered, contact ianchute@hotmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
